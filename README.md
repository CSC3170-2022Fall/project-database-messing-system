## Project Specification

<!-- You should remove the terms/sentence that is not necessary considering your option/branch/difficulty choice -->

After thorough discussion, our team made the choice and the specification information is listed below:

- Our option choice is: **Option 3**

## Project Abstract

<!-- TODO -->
This project involves writing a miniature relational database management system (DBMS) that stores tables of data, where a table consists of some number of labeled columns of information. Our system will include a very simple query language for extracting information from these tables. For the purposes of this project, we will deal only with very small databases, and therefore will not consider too much about speed and efficiency. But we will still consider part of the efficiency improvement when designing the DBMS. Here's what we implemented in this system:

Basic coding:

- Filling the code templates provided by UCB.

Advance coding:

- Take **data type (int/double/string)** into consideration while creating the table and doing other operations;

- Implement the operations including **join, commit, rollback**;

- Implement aggregate functions including **max(), min(), avg(), round(), count()**;

- Implement additional keyword including **as, like, between, where (not) in, order by, group by, primary key**;

- Version Control: Use **snapshot** strategy with **SHA-1** as version name and **trie** as version tree;
	
- Application: **re-implement Assignmnet 2**.
