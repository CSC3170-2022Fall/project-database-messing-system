     *  by the ith COLUMN (for each i from 0 to M-1).
     *
     *  More specifically, if _table is the Table number corresponding to
     *  COLUMN i, then the ith value of the newly created Row should come from
     *  ROWS[_table].

     *  Even more specifically, the ith value of the newly created Row should
     *  be equal to ROWS[_table].get(_column), where _column is the column

     *  potentially clickable link it is! Just not in source. You might
     *  consider converting this spec to HTML using the Javadoc command.
